# ParticlePad
A particle engine controllable by Novation's Launchpad written in Processing. 

Open and Launch "ParticlePad" with a Launchpad connected. 

The first three columns act as sliders for Particle Spawn Count, Particle Gravity, and Particle Trail Alpha.  

The large matrix acts as gravitators for the particles, while the smaller matrix spawns particles in the corresponding locations on screen.  

The last 3x2 matrix serves as additional options: the first column has no functions, while the second provides a mode to have the mouse serve as a gravitator, a continious particle spawn trigger, and the last (very bottom right) pad deletes all particles on screen.
